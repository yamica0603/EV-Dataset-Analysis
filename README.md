# EV-Dataset-Analysis
This project involves the end-to-end data processing and analysis of an electric vehicle dataset, focusing on vehicles in the Washington area. The dataset includes various features such as the model year, electric range, manufacturer (make), model, type of electric vehicle, and base MSRP, among others.The dataset is taken from Kaggle Electric Vehicle Data (1997-2024) (update version).

Libraries Used:
    Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
    Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

The project provides key insights into the factors influencing electric vehicle specifications, pricing, and type prediction. Data transformations and visualizations helped in understanding trends, and the predictive models achieved substantial accuracy in classifying the type of electric vehicle.
